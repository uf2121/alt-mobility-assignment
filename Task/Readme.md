Most orders are pending, delivered, or shipped, with slightly more 'pending' orders in number than 'delivered' orders.
(Pending: 5069, Delivered: 5057, Shipped: 4874)

Delivered Sales in a Month's Analysis:

Delivered orders' total sales register significant fluctuations in months.
Pockets of peak observed in May 2020 and July 2020, reflecting promotional or seasonal impacts.
A declining trend was observed steadily after 2021.

Repeat Customer Behavior:

Numerous customers have placed several orders.
The highest repeat customers ordered 7–8 times, indicating high brand loyalty in some user groups.

Payment Trends:

Payment success and failure rates were examined. Nevertheless, in all months, the data appears to record zero successful or failed transactions in the given dataset.

Observations from Customer Retention Analysis
Retention Rates:

The customer retention rates decline sharply after the first purchase month for all cohorts.
A steep fall is seen from Month 1 to Month 2, reflecting difficulties in retaining customers after initial interactions.

Cohort Analysis Insights:

Previous cohorts (e.g., 2020–2021) experienced marginally improved retention over time compared to the recent ones (2023–2025).
Although steadily decreasing, a small percentage of consumers remain engaged for 20+ months after first purchase.

New vs. Repeat Customers:

New customer acquisition is relatively flat month over month.
But repeat customer numbers are much lower, indicating a deficiency in customer loyalty and re-engagement.








commendations for Alt Mobility
Enhance First 30 Days Engagement:
As churn is most intense immediately following the initial purchase, use onboarding initiatives, loyalty rewards, and tailored email reminders to keep consumers longer.

Prioritize High-Value Repeat Buyers:
Identify repeat buyers who make over 5 purchases and offer them special offers or memberships.

Enhance Payment Experience:
Examine the zero payment success/failure reporting in the data. If actual, enhance transparency or systems integration. If a collection issue, address it immediately.

Seasonal Campaigns:
Schedule significant promotions based on noted high-sales months (e.g., May–July) to gain maximum ROI.

Examine Pending Orders:
A high level of pending orders reflects a potential bottleneck in operations. Resolution immediately will prevent loss of revenue.
